      <p>The OCF has multiple physical machines. Some of these are hypervisors, which host virtual servers running on QEMU and KVM. We also have servers that are workers for our Kubernetes cluster, and others comprise our High Performance Computing cluster.
      <p>Below is a list of some servers and other hosts at the OCF. VMs are grouped under the hypervisor hosting them.</p>
