## The mission    {mission}

The OCF is an all-volunteer, student-run, Chartered Program of the [Associated
Students of the University of California (ASUC)][asuc] dedicated to free
computing for all [University of California at Berkeley][berkeley] students,
faculty, and staff.  The mission of the OCF is to provide an environment where
no member of Berkeley's campus community is denied the computer resources he or
she seeks, and to appeal to all members of the Berkeley campus community with
unsatisfied computing needs and to provide a place for those interested in
computing to fully explore that interest.

## What do we do?    {what-we-do}

The Open Computing Facility provides free computing services to students,
faculty, and staff, ranging from printing to expiration-free web space to Unix
shell accounts to email. Furthermore, the OCF operates a highly frequented
long-hours computing lab with a generally high volunteer-staff-to-user ratio
for accessible in-person support, as well as online support. In addition to
these user services, the group also hosts numerous student group websites, and
provides support to these and other organizations on campus.

To be able to do this, we are always aiming to secure more resources to fully
meet the needs of everyone in the campus community.  Our primary resources are
our GNU/Linux workstations and servers, entirely administered by [[student
volunteers|doc staff]]. These resources are located within our computing lab on
the ground floor of MLK Student Union.

To help people explore the field of computing and educate them about the
resources available, the OCF also provides a variety of educational services.
We used to co-sponsor a series of Help Sessions, short classes taught
throughout the semester on a wide range of computing topics (focusing on
resources available to the Berkeley campus community), along with hosting the
[UNIX SysAdmin DeCal][decal]. Additionally, the OCF used to conduct
career fairs in the past with its sister organization, the
[Computer Science Undergraduate Association][csua]. Now, we host regular [[Tech Talks|doc staff/techtalks]] that explore new technologies and how they might pertain to elements of the
OCF infrastructure. We also offer e-mail and in-person with our volunteer
staff members, as well as online sources of information about computing on the
Berkeley campus and how to use the available resources.

Policies for this cluster and decisions for the OCF organization are made by
the OCF Board of Directors, an open body composed of OCF members who are
interested in participating in the decision-making process. The Board
convenes at BoD Meetings, held every week when classes are in session,
which are open to the public and provide a chance for any user to express their
concerns or opinions about the OCF. All OCF members are welcome to join the
Board of Directors, and the general public is welcome to attend BoD Meetings.
[Minutes of all previous meetings][minutes] are available online.
