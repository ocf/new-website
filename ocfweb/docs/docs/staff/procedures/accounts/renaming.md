[[!meta title="Rename an account"]]

We should sparingly rename an user account, and only do so when it is
necessary (e.g. typo in the username).

To rename a individual account, `sorry` the account with the old name and
make a `note` of why you are changing the username. Then manually create an
account using `approve`, and [[associate|doc staff/procedures/accounts/association]]
the user's `calnetUID` manually. Be sure to `note` the reason and previous
username in the new account note file.

#### Note
When using the OCF web interface the user will see old account as a dropdown option,
however user cannot use the old accoun as it is sorried.
