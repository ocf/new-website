[[!meta title="Managed switch (blackhole)"]]

We use a [Cisco Catalyst 2960S-48TS-L Switch][switch] in our server rack. Each
desktop connects first to the back of a patch panel, and then from a port on
the patch panel to a port on the switch. The servers connect directly to the
switch, as does our uplink to IST.

In its current operation, the switch performs mostly just like an unmanaged
switch, but with a couple extra features:

1. [Spanning-tree protocol BPDUs][stp] are dropped on all ports, including from
   IST. This is done because IST periodically sends BPDUs to us, and if we
   accidentally send them back (or send any of our own), their router
   automatically shuts down our internet connection for some period of time
   (about an hour?). This has taken out our internet a few times in the past
   when we've accidentally created either virtual or physical loops in our
   network.

2. [IPv6 Router Advertisements (and similar)][ipv6-ra] are dropped on all
   ports, since IST bombards us with RAs regularly, and hosts will
   auto-configure themselves with random IPv6 addresses in our subnet (but
   which we firewall off in both directions, leading to broken IPv6). We tried
   to get another `/64` to be used for SLAAC, but IST wouldn't give us one. So
   instead we plan to probably use DHCPv6 at some point in the future.

Ideally, we'd eventually like to use some of its more advanced features to do
things like prevent desktops from spoofing servers.

The desktops are connected to ports 1 through 36. The servers are using ports
37 through 47. The IST uplink is port 48.


## Administering the switch over SSH    {administer}

To connect, use `ssh admin@blackhole`. You can find the password in the list of
admin passwords.

Some handy commands (first run `enable` and enter your password again):

These commands are similar to the commands used for the [[firewall|doc
staff/backend/firewall]], so have a look there for more details.

* Show the running config: `show running-config`

* Enter config options: `configure terminal` to start, `exit` to stop again.

* Save the running config: `copy running-config startup-config`

  (always do this after testing your changes, or they'll revert upon restart!)


## Automatic config diffs

We use [rancid](http://www.shrubbery.net/rancid/) to both back up and send us
email diffs of the switch's config. This is managed through the [`ocf_rancid`
puppet module][ocf_rancid].
