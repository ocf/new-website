[[!meta title="i3wm"]]

`i3wm` or `i3` is is a tiling window manager we use on `tornado`, which is the computer behind the ocf tv.
To learn how to access the ocf tv, see [[ocf-tv|doc staff/howto/other/ocf-tv]]. A tiling window manager is
a window manager that breaks the screen into different tiles, and places applications into these tiles,
which are normally controlled by keyboard shortcuts instead of by dragging and dropping.
