[[!meta title="Email"]]

Email sent to your username @ocf.berkeley.edu (e.g.
`username@ocf.berkeley.edu`) will be forwarded to a contact email address of
your choosing.

To configure a forwarding address, log in via [[SSH|doc services/shell]] and
enter the `update-email` command to view or update your contact email address.

Note that you are required to keep your contact address up-to-date for as long
as you continue to use your account. While we do not proactively disable
accounts without emails, if we need to contact you for any reason and cannot,
your account will be disabled. This is true for both individual and group
accounts.

## Student groups    {groups}

We provide email virtual hosting for student groups who have a [[virtual
host|doc services/vhost]] (e.g. mygroup.berkeley.edu). See [[here|doc
services/vhost/mail]] for instructions on requesting email hosting and
configuring email addresses.

## Individual accounts    {individual}

Mail service for individual accounts was discontinued over summer 2014, but we
are still offering email forwarding for individual accounts indefinitely.

Note that sending mail from your individual OCF account is no longer possible.
