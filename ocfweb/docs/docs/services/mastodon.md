[[!meta title="Mastodon"]]

Mastodon is a federated microblogging platform and social network. See the
[official project homepage](https://joinmastodon.org/) for more information.

The OCF operates a Mastodon instance, open to all members. To create an account,
go to https://mastodon.ocf.berkeley.edu. Use `<ocfusername>@ocf.berkeley.edu` as
your email address (emails sent will be [[forwarded|doc services/mail]] to your
Berkeley email), and use the same username as your OCF account. Note that
Mastodon passwords are separate from OCF account passwords!

## Alternate usernames
If you would like to use a username different from your OCF account username,
email [help@ocf.berkeley.edu](mailto:help@ocf.berkeley.edu) to request a custom
username.

## Rules

See our [server rules](https://mastodon.ocf.berkeley.edu/about/more).
