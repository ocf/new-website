[[!meta title="XMPP"]]

XMPP (formerly Jabber) is a federated chat protocol. All OCF members can get an
XMPP account with JID `username@ocf.berkeley.edu`. Our server supports most
modern XEPs, including end-to-end encrypted chats with OMEMO.

XMPP accounts are currently available upon request. If you are interested, email
[help@ocf.berkeley.edu](mailto:help@ocf.berkeley.edu) with your OCF username.
