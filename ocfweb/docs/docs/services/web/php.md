[[!meta title="PHP"]]

`death`, the OCF webserver, currently runs PHP 5.6 with the following
non-standard packages installed:

* APCu (opcode caching)
* cURL (networking library)
* GD (graphics library)
* Mcrypt (cryptography library)
* MySQL (database)
* SQLite (database)

For a full list of available modules, run `phpinfo()` from a PHP script.

## Custom PHP settings    {custom-settings}

If the default PHP settings are problematic for your site (for example, if you
require larger than normal file uploads), you can customize the PHP settings
used by creating [a `.user.ini` file][.user.ini] inside your web root.

In order to maintain compatibility with the OCF's PHP settings, we highly
recommend *not* copying an entire `php.ini`* or `.user.ini` file from the web
or from another server. Instead, we advise you to create an empty `.user.ini`
and add only the settings you wish to change.

Note that `.user.ini` filename should be used, as our webserver will not look
for (per-user) `php.ini` files.

### Example `.user.ini` file     {example}

The following file, located at `~/public_html/.user.ini`, is an example of a
good `.user.ini` file.

    ; raise max upload and POST sizes
    upload_max_filesize = 32M
    post_max_size = 32M

    ; raise maximum number of input variables
    max_input_vars = 20000
