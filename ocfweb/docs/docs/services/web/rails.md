[[!meta title="Ruby on Rails"]]


Ruby on Rails is a popular web framework for Ruby applications.

## Creating a New Application    {new}

To create a new Rails application, use the `rails` command-line interface. For
example, to create an application called `foo` in your home directory, run the
command:

    rails new foo

This may take some time.

## Hosting Your Application     {hosting}

OCF allows hosting of Rails applications via FastCGI. This requires you to
install the `fcgi` gem and create a FastCGI wrapper script.

### Install `fcgi` gem

1. Make sure the line `gem 'fcgi'` appears somewhere in your project's
   `Gemfile` (located at the root of the project).

2. Run `bundle install` from the root of your project to update installed gems.
   This will ensure that the `fcgi` gem is installed.

### Create FastCGI wrapper script     {fastcgi}

To host your application, create a file called `dispatch.fcgi` in your web root
(`~/public_html/`) based on the following template:

    #!/usr/bin/ruby
    ENV['HOME'] = `/bin/bash -c "echo ~"`
    ENV['GEM_HOME'] = ENV['HOME'] + '/.gem/ruby/2.1.5/gems'
    ENV['GEM_PATH'] = ENV['HOME'] + '/.gem/ruby/2.1.5'

    APP_PATH = ENV['HOME'] + '/foo'

    require_relative APP_PATH + '/config/environment'

    class Rack::PathInfoRewriter
      def initialize(app)
        @app = app
      end

      def call(env)
        env.delete('SCRIPT_NAME')
        parts = env['REQUEST_URI'].split('?')
        env['PATH_INFO'] = parts[0]
        env['QUERY_STRING'] = parts[1].to_s
        @app.call(env)
      end
    end

    Rack::Handler::FastCGI.run Rack::PathInfoRewriter.new(Foo::Application)

Be sure to adjust:

* The path to your application (`APP_PATH` variable)
* The name of your application (last line). Change `Foo::Application` to
  `MyApp::Application` where `MyApp` is the name of your application.

Once you've added the `dispatch.fcgi` file, mark it as executable:

    chmod +x dispatch.fcgi

### Rewrite requests to the FastCGI wrapper

Create a file called `.htaccess` in your web root (or a subdirectory)
containing the following lines:

    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteBase /
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /~user/dispatch.fcgi [QSA,L]

Be sure to replace `user` with your username.

### Debugging     {debugging}

If you see an error page when trying to load your app, you may find the
webserver's logs useful. You can access them via SSH in the following
locations:

* error log: `/opt/httpd/error.log` (most useful)
* suexec log: `/opt/httpd/httpd-suexec.log` (only useful in rare cases)

Once your app has started running, changes you make to the Ruby code or
templates won't take effect for a few hours. To apply changes immediately, you
can touch the dispatch.fcgi file with the command:

     $ touch dispatch.fcgi
