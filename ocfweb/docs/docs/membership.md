[[!meta title="Joining the OCF"]]

## Before you begin

* Check the [[membership eligibility|doc membership/eligibility]] page to make
  sure you are eligible for an OCF account. For example, all currently-enrolled
  students and active student groups registered with the LEAD Center are
  eligible.

* OCF accounts do not expire, so make sure you have not made an account in the
  past. If you have forgotten your account name or password, please do not
  request a new account. Instead, reset your [[password|doc services/account]].

* Choose an OCF account name that is based on your real name (for individual
  accounts) or your group's name (for group accounts). It is unlikely you will
  be able to change your account name after your request has been processed.

## Individual accounts    {individual}

* Individual accounts are associated with a single person and may not be
  shared.
* Individual accounts are **not** eligible for [[virtual hosting|doc
  services/vhost]] except for faculty and staff accounts.
* Individual accounts are eligible for [[printing|doc services/lab/printing]].

**[[Request an account online|register]]**

You will be prompted to log in with CalNet. Then follow the instructions to
make your request. Your account name must be based on your real name.

Feel free to [[contact us|doc contact]] if you experience difficulties in the
request or you have questions.

Then, wait for your account to be created. (below)

## Group accounts    {group}

* Group accounts are associated with a group and may be shared by members of
  the group.
* Group accounts are eligible for [[virtual hosting|doc services/vhost]].
* Group accounts are **not** eligible for [[printing|doc
  services/lab/printing]].

Follow this procedure to get a group account:

1. **Prepare appropriate documents and identification.** See the [[membership
   eligibility|doc membership/eligibility]] page for information on the
   documents and identification you will be asked to present for verification
   at the time you submit your account form.

2. **Have the authorized person come to [[staff hours|staff-hours]].** For
   groups registered with the LEAD Center, that means a signatory. Otherwise,
   it's the person named in the documentation letter (and yes, you must bring
   documentation!).  The account will be created during your visit.


## Account life

We don't actively close accounts. You don't need to re-apply for a new account
every semester, and you can still use your account after you graduate.

Because the OCF is funded by students for student use, we cater our services to
students, but it doesn't mean that your OCF account stops working after you
stop being a student. However, we will occasionally make changes to our
services based on the needs of current students and the abilities of current
OCF staff, so we can't promise all OCF account privileges and services into
perpetuity.
