#### Why might I want an OCF account? What do I get? How do I use OCF services?    {why}

Access to computing by the students for the students!

More specifically, we have a [[list of services|doc services]].

Check out [[our staff recruitment website|about-staff]]!

#### It's been a week since I requested an account, what happened!

Accounts are typically processed immediately. If your account requires
additional approval by staff, it may take a few days (usually less) to be
manually approved. If this was the case, you will have been informed during
account creation.

In most cases when people think their account has not been created, the email
landed in their spam folder. Check that first, or try to [[reset your
password|change_password]] to see if your account has been created.

#### I think I left something in the lab, can you tell me if it's there?    {lost}

**Please do not email us about items lost in the lab.** The front desk is
staffed by paid employees, not by OCF volunteers. If you email us, the front
desk staff *will not see it*. If you've lost something, you should instead stop
by in-person to ask for it.

#### I have an account. Does it expire? Will it still work?    {expiration}

It should still work. Our current policy is to leave accounts alone after
graduation. See [[account|doc services/account]].
