<h1>Error Creating Account</h1>
<p>Whoops, seems like your account was not created.</p>
<p>No fears, though. You should have received an email with more information.</p>
<p>You could also try to <a href="{% url "request_account" %}">create the account again</a> or <a href="https://wiki.ocf.berkeley.edu/contact/">contact OCF staff.</a></p>
