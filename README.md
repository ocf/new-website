## Working on `ocfweb`

Clone the repo, and be sure to check out submodules:

    $ git clone git@github.com:ocf/ocfweb.git
    $ git submodule update --init

If you run into problems with scss where it can't import bootstrap, it's
because you forgot to run the second command.


### Running in development mode

Either on supernova, or on your own staff VM<sup>[0]</sup>, run `make dev`.
The first time will take a while, but future runs will be almost instant
thanks to [pip-faster](https://github.com/Yelp/pip-faster).

It will start listening on a deterministically random port (really, 8000 plus
the last 3 digits of your user id) which is printed to you. You can then view
the site in development.


### Building SCSS

Run `make scss` to build SCSS. You can also use `make watch-scss` to rebuild it
automatically when SCSS files change.


### Running tests

To run tests locally, run `make test`. Please don't push to master with
failing testsâ€”Jenkins will refuse to deploy your code, and nobody will be able
to deploy until it's fixed.

If you make a pull request to the OCF GitHub organization from your fork of
ocfweb, Jenkins will attempt to build and test your branch automatically.
If your build fails, you can log into Jenkins to see which tests you've failed
and fix them, if running `make test` locally didn't already tell you.

You can run individual tests with `venv/bin/pytest -k <test_name>` or
`venv/bin/pytest <test_file>::<test_name>` if running all tests is too slow.


### Running pre-commit

We use [pre-commit](http://pre-commit.com/) to lint our code before commiting.
While some of the rules might seem a little arbitrary, it helps keep the style
consistent, and ensure annoying things like trailing whitespace don't creep in.

You can simply run `make install-hooks` to install the necessary git hooks;
once installed, pre-commit will run every time you commit.

Alternatively, if you'd rather not install any hooks, you can simply use `make
test` as usual, which will also run the hooks.

Almost all build failures of ocfweb can be tied to something `pre-commit`
probably would have caught.


### Installing packages

To install a package to the production environment, add it to
`requirements-minimal.txt`, then run `make update-requirements`. Similarly, to
install to the development environment, add to `requirements-dev-minimal.txt`
and run `make update-requirements`. Use as loose a version requirement as
possible, e.g. try `django` or `django>=1.10,<1.10.999` before
`django==1.10.0`.


-----

[0]: In order to run ocfweb on your staffvm without running into problems,
you will have to add the `ocf_ocfweb::dev_config` class to your
[Hiera node config](https://github.com/ocf/puppet/tree/master/hieradata/nodes).
Specifically, add:

    classes:
        - ocf_ocfweb::dev_config

It's probably easier to just run everything on `supernova`.
